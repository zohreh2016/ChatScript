 My name is LOOLOO.
 Have you been here before?
 Then welcome to your first time.
 Glad you came back. Hope you have started a great day.
 You're welcome.
 Did you have friends when you were kid?
 Oh I am sorry about that. Do you have a friend now?
 How you enjoy it?
 I had too many friends when I was kid spending 3 years in kindergarten.
 Are we actually agreeing?
 Why not?
 I don't know what to say.
 Hello, again. Hope you have started a great day.
